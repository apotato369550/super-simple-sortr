# Super Simple Sortr V.1
Hello everyone! This was a small project I worked on to try and strenghten my knowledge
in the different sorting algorithms. It was really fun to make and I hope you enjoy.

This application houses 12 different sorting algorithms to be visualized namely:
* Bubble Sort
* BogoSort
* Cocktail Shaker Sort
* CombSort
* Counting Sort
* Heap Sort
* Heap Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Merge Sort
* QuickSort
* ShellSort
* and lastly Timsort

To run the application, just clone the different files and run the "main.py"

This program was made in Python 2.7
